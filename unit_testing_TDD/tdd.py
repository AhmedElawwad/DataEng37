"""
TDD
1. Write the test
2. Write the code needed to make the test pass
3. Refactor your code

You have a suite of test and run it multiple time
It changes how you code and end up coding better
it's lean and does what needed
It is not easy to run the test after you code
It break down the problem  into smaller problems
